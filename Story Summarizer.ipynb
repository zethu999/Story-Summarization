The most somber and tragic ideal. Unknown to himself. Whether he wished it or not whether he consented or not. The author of this immense and strange work. Is one of the strong race of revolutionist rice's. Bounce that goes straight to the goal. Body to body he sees his modern society from old he wrecked something. From these an illusion from those of hope from wanna catch words from another amount. He ransacked vice he dissected passion. He sucked out and sounded man so hot and trails brain the abyss that each one has within himself. I'm by grace of his free and vigorous nature by a privilege of the intellect about time which having seen revolutions face-to-face can see more clearly the destiny of humanity. And comprehend providence plaza. Belzak redeem himself smiling and severe from those formidable studies which produced melancholy and molly are on misanthropy in russo. This is what he has accomplished among us this is the work which he has left us a walk lost it and solid. A monument robustly piled in layers of granite. From the heights of which hair after his renowned shells shine in splenda. Great men make their own pedestal. The future will be answerable for the statue. His death stupefied paris. Only a few months ago he had to come back to france feeling that he was dying he wish to see his country again as one who would embrace his mother on the 8th of a distant voyage. His life was short but full. More filled with beads and days. This powerful worker never fatigued this philosopher this finca this poet this genius has lived among us that life of strife her clothes and come back, in all times to all great men. Today. He is at peace. He escapes contention and hatred. On the same day he enters into glory. And the tube. They're off to beyond the clouds which were above our heads he will shine among the stars of his country. Or you who are here are you not tempted to envy him. Whatever maybe a griffin presents of sasha lost. Let us accept these catastrophes with resignation. Let us accept in it whatever is distressing and severe. It is good perhaps. It is necessary perhaps. In a teapot like how is that from time to time the great dead phil communicate to spirit. Devoured with skepticism and down. A religious fervor. Providence knows what it does when it puts people face-to-face with the soup read mysteries how many gives them.. \n"
